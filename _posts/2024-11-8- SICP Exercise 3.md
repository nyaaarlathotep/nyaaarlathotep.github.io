# Chapter 3

> Until now, all our procedures could be viewed as specifications for computing mathematical functions. A call to a procedure computed the value of the function applied to the given arguments, and two calls to the same procedure with the same arguments always produced the same result.

> In general, programming with assignment forces us to carefully consider the relative orders of the assignments to make sure that each statement is using the correct version of the variables that have been changed. This issue simply does not arise in functional programs.[11](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/full-text/book/book-Z-H-20.html#footnote_Temp_339) The complexity of imperative programs becomes even worse if we consider applications in which several processes execute concurrently. We will return to this in section [3.4](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/full-text/book/book-Z-H-23.html#%_sec_3.4). First, however, we will address the issue of providing a computational model for expressions that involve assignment, and explore the uses of objects with local state in designing simulations.

substitution model of evaluation:

>  To apply a compound procedure to arguments, evaluate the body of the procedure with each formal parameter replaced by the corresponding argument. 



## 3.1

### 3.1

```
(define (make-accumulator balance)
  (lambda (amount)
        (begin (set! balance 
                     (+ balance amount))
               balance)
))
```

### 3.2

```
(define (make-monitored f)
  (let ((count 0))
  (define (dispatch m)
    (cond ((eq? m 'how-many-calls?) count)
          ((eq? m 'reset-count) (set! count 0))
          (else (begin (set! count (+ count 1)) (f m) ))))

### 3.3

```
(define (make-account pass balance)
  (define (withdraw amount)
    (if (>= balance amount)
        (begin (set! balance 
                     (- balance amount))
               balance)
        "Insufficient funds"))
  (define (deposit amount)
    (set! balance (+ balance amount))
    balance)
  (define (dispatch key m)
    (cond ((not (eq? pass key)) "Incorrect password")
          ((eq? m 'withdraw) withdraw)
          ((eq? m 'deposit) deposit)
          (else (error "Unknown request: 
                 MAKE-ACCOUNT" m))))
  dispatch)
```

```
> ((acc 'secret-password 'withdraw) 40)

```

OK.

```
(define (make-account balance pass)
  (define (withdraw amount)
    (if (>= balance amount)
        (begin (set! balance 
                     (- balance amount))
               balance)
        "Insufficient funds"))
  (define (deposit amount)
    (set! balance (+ balance amount))
    balance)
  (define (dispatch m)
    (cond ((eq? m 'withdraw) withdraw)
          ((eq? m 'deposit) deposit)
          (else (error "Unknown request: 
                 MAKE-ACCOUNT" m))))
  (lambda (key m)
  	(if (eq? key pass)
  		(dispatch m)
  		(lambda (X) "Incorrect password")
  	)
  )
)
```

### 3.4

LOL.

Can they combined together?

```
(define call-the-cops "COPS COMING")
```

```
(define (make-account balance pass)
  (let ((try 0))
  (define (withdraw amount)
    (if (>= balance amount)
        (begin (set! balance 
                     (- balance amount))
               balance)
        "Insufficient funds"))
  (define (deposit amount)
    (set! balance (+ balance amount))
    balance)
  (define (dispatch m)
    (cond ((eq? m 'withdraw) withdraw)
          ((eq? m 'deposit) deposit)
          (else (error "Unknown request: 
                 MAKE-ACCOUNT" m))))
  (lambda (key m)
  	(if (eq? key pass)
  		(dispatch m)
  		(begin
  			(set! try (+ try 1))
  			(if (> try 7)
  				(lambda (X) call-the-cops)
  				(lambda (X) "Incorrect password")
  			)
  		)
  	)
  )
  )
)
```

### 3.5

Well, the `MIT-Scheme` is not the same as the racket, I need to rewrite `random-in-range`.

```
(define (random-in-range low high)
  (let ((range (- high low)))
    (+ low (random range))))
```

```
(define (estimate-integral P x1 x2 y1 y2 trials)
  (* 4 (random-integral-test P x1 x2 y1 y2 trials)))
(define (random-integral-test  P x1 x2 y1 y2 trials)
  (define (iter trials-remaining trials-passed)
    (let ((x (random-in-range x1 x2)))
      (let ((y (random-in-range y1 y2)))
        (cond ((= trials-remaining 0)   
               (/ trials-passed trials))
              ((P x y)
               (iter (- trials-remaining 1)
                     (+ trials-passed 1)
                     ))
              (else
               (iter (- trials-remaining 1)
                     trials-passed
                     ))))))
  (iter trials 0))


(define (get-pi trials)
    (exact->inexact
        (estimate-integral (lambda (x y)
                               (< (+ (square x)
                                     (square y))
                                1.0))
                           -1.0
                           1.0
                           -1.0
                           1.0
                           trials)))
```

I could use the original `monte-carlo`, it seems much easier.

> ```
> (define (estimate-integral p? x1 x2 y1 y2 trials)
>     (* 4
>        (monte-carlo trials
>                     (lambda ()
>                         (p? (random-in-range x1 x2)
>                             (random-in-range y1 y2))))))
> ```

>                                      (square y))
>                                 1.0))
>                            -1.0

>                            -1.0
>                            1.0
>                            trials)))
> ```

### 3.6

We don't have `rand` or ` rand-update` in Racket. Oh, I find something: [2 SICP Language](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/SICP_Language.html). OK, it still doesn't work.

I guess it's Just another dispatch.

```
 (define rand 
   (let ((x random-init)) 
     (define (dispatch message) 
       (cond ((eq? message 'generate) 
               (begin (set! x (rand-update x)) 
                      x)) 
             ((eq? message 'reset) 
               (lambda (new-value) (set! x new-value))))) 
     dispatch)) 

```

### 3.7

```
(define (make-account balance pass)
  (define (withdraw amount)
    (if (>= balance amount)
        (begin (set! balance 
                     (- balance amount))
               balance)
        "Insufficient funds"))
  (define (deposit amount)
    (set! balance (+ balance amount))
    balance)
  (define (dispatch m)
    (cond ((eq? m 'withdraw) withdraw)
          ((eq? m 'deposit) deposit)
          (else (error "Unknown request: 
                 MAKE-ACCOUNT" m))))
  (lambda (key m)
  	(if (eq? key pass)
  		(dispatch m)
  		(lambda (X) "Incorrect password")
  	)
  )
)
```

```
(define (make-joint account old-pass new-pass)
  (lambda (key m)
    (if (eq? key new-pass)
      (account old-pass m)
      (error "Incorrect password" key)
    )
  )
)
```

The book said I may modify the 3.3 answer, while I just proxy it. There may be some better answer?

### 3.8

Wow, quite Interesting.

```
(define (f add)
	
	(let ((a -1))
		(begin (set! a (+ add))
			a
		)
	)
)
```

This is another sign of *referentially transparent*.

```
> (define f (make-f))
> (f 0)
-1
> (f 1)
0

```

```
> (define f (make-f))
> (f 1)
0
> (f 0)
0

```

## 3.2

> Î»-expression was evaluated to produce the procedure

A procedure as a pair is created in an environment.

> To apply a procedure to arguments, create a new environment containing a frame that binds the parameters to the values of the arguments. **The enclosing environment of this frame is the environment specified by the procedure**. Now, within this new environment, evaluate the procedure body. 

The enclosing environment of this frame is the environment in which the procedure is created.

I wonder which part is frame and which is env. The body of the lambda (i.e. the pointers' pair) is frame?

> two key properties that make local procedure definitions a useful technique for modularizing programs:
>
> - The names of the local procedures do not interfere with names external to the enclosing procedure, because the local procedure names will be bound in the frame that the procedure creates when it is run, rather than being bound in the global environment.
> - The local procedures can access the arguments of the enclosing procedure, simply by using parameter names as free variables. This is because the body of the local procedure is evaluated in an environment that is subordinate to the evaluation environment for the enclosing procedure.

Will `sqrt` create a lot of env? There is a recursive call.

> Since Scheme provides no way to mutate a symbol, this sharing is undetectable. Note also that the sharing is what enables us to compare symbols using `eq?`, which simply checks equality of pointers.

### 3.9

![3.9](/images/sicp/3.9.png)

### 3.10

I guess...

There is an unused env which stands for the `((lambda (balance) â¨bodyâ©) 100)`

![3.10-1](/images/sicp/3.10-1.png)

![3.10-2](/images/sicp/3.10-2.png)

![3.10-3](/images/sicp/3.10-3.png)

### 3.11

`(define acc (make-account 50))`

![3.11-1](/images/sicp/3.11-1.png)

`((acc 'deposit) 40)`

I'm not sure how to express the another call `(( ) )`.

![3.11-2](/images/sicp/3.11-2.png)

`((acc 'deposit) 60)`

![3.11-3](/images/sicp/3.11-3.png)

` (define acc2 (make-account 100))`

They only share the same `dispatch` code.

![3.11-4](/images/sicp/3.11-4.png)

### 3.12

Drawings again.

Now we don't have `set-cdr!`. Racket! OK, I just need to import them.

```
(require rnrs/mutable-pairs-6)
(require compatibility/mlist)

(define (mappend x y)
 (if (null? x)
 y
 (mcons (mcar x) (append (mcdr x) y))))

(define (append! x y)
 (set-cdr! (mlast-pair x) y)
 x)
  (define (mlast-pair x)
 (if (null? (mcdr x)) x (mlast-pair (mcdr x))))
```

> ```
> (define x (mlist 'a 'b))
>  (define y (mlist 'c 'd))
>  (define z (mappend x y))
>  z
> (mcons 'a (mcons 'b (mcons 'c (mcons 'd '()))))
>  (mcdr x)
> ```

```
(b)
```

> ```
> (define w (append! x y))
>  w
> (mcons 'a (mcons 'b (mcons 'c (mcons 'd '()))))
>  (mcdr x)
> ```

```
(b c d)
```

I don't want to draw. This problem illustrate the difference between pointer and value manipulation. `append` creates a new list and `append!` change the original list. 

### 3.13

![3.13](/images/sicp/3.13.png)

>   What happens if we try to compute (last-pair z)?

Infinite loop.

### 3.14

It seems the `mystery` reverse the order of the given list. Besides, it consumes no extra memory space and the order of growth is O(n).

```
(a b c d)
```

```
(d c b a)
(a)
```

![3.14](/images/sicp/3.14.png)

### 3.15

![3.15](/images/sicp/3.15.png)

These are the effects of pointers. `z1` has the two pointers point to the same pair so the `set-to-wow!` seemingly change the both part of the pair.

### 3.16

> made up of exactly three pairs

Does that mean three `cons`?

```
> (count-pairs (cons 3 (cons 2 (cons 1 null))))
3
> (define a (cons 2 '(1)))
> a
'(2 1)
> (define b (cons a (cdr a)))
> b
'((2 1) 1)
> (count-pairs b)
4
```

```
> (define a (cons 1 null))
> (define b (cons a a))
> (define c (cons b b))
> a
'(1)
> b
'((1) 1)
> c
'(((1) 1) (1) 1)
> (count-pairs c)
7

```

![3.16](/images/sicp/3.16.png)

### 3.17

We need to use the `eq?` to remove calculated pairs.

```
(define (count-pairs x)
  (define counted null)
  (define (aux n)
    (if (or (not (pair? n)) (memq n counted))
      0
      (begin
      (set! counted (cons n counted))
      (+ (aux (car n))
         (aux (cdr n))
         1))
      )
  )
  (aux x)
)
```

I wonder whether this would calculate different pairs with the same value.

```
> a
'(3)
> (define b (cons a a))
> (eq? (car b) (cdr b))
#t
> (eq? a '(3))
#f> (memq '(3) (cons (car b) null))
#f
> (cons (car b) null)
'((3))
> (memq (car b) (cons (car b) null))
'((3))

> (memq '(3) (cons (car b) null))
#f
> (cons (car b) null)
'((3))
> (memq (car b) (cons (car b) null))
'((3))

```

Never mind. `eq?` only checks the pointer.

### 3.18

Typical.

```
(define (loop? x)
    (define (aux a b)
        (cond 
            ((eq? a b) #t)
            ((null? (cdr b) #t))
            ((null? (cdr (cdr b)) #t))
            (else (aux (cdr a) (cdr (cdr b)) ))
        )
    )
    (aux x x)
)
```

### 3.19

As above.

### 3.20

It's not a pair any more, but a procedure.

```
(define (cons x y)
  (define (set-x! v) (set! x v))
  (define (set-y! v) (set! y v))
  (define (dispatch m)
    (cond ((eq? m 'car) x)
          ((eq? m 'cdr) y)
          ((eq? m 'set-car!) set-x!)
          ((eq? m 'set-cdr!) set-y!)
          (else (error "Undefined 
                 operation: CONS" m))))
  dispatch)

(define (car z) (z 'car))
(define (cdr z) (z 'cdr))

(define (set-car! z new-value)
  ((z 'set-car!) new-value)
  z)

(define (set-cdr! z new-value)
  ((z 'set-cdr!) new-value)
  z)
```

![3.20 1](/images/sicp/3.20-1.png)

```
(define x (cons 1 2))
(define z (cons x x))
```

![3.20 2](/images/sicp/3.20-2.png)

```
(set-car! (cdr z) 17)
```

![3.20 3](/images/sicp/3.20-2.png)

Gross. I still don't know how to express `(() )`.

### 3.21

```
(define (print-queue queue)
    (mcar queue)
)
```

The interpreter print the queue's front-ptr and rear-ptr at the same time. So it seems the element get inserted twice. Whether the queue is empty depends on the front-ptr which is relevant to the concrete implementation of `delete-queue!` and `empty-queue?`. I wonder this could really disturb the garbage collector.

### 3.22

```
(define (make-queue)
    (let ((front-ptr null )
    (rear-ptr null ))
    (define (empty-queue? queue)
        (null? (front-ptr queue)))
    (define (set-front-ptr! queue item)
        (set! front-ptr item))
    (define (set-rear-ptr! queue item)
        (set! rear-ptr item))
    (define (insert-queue! queue item)
        (let ((new-pair (mcons item '())))
        (cond
            ((empty-queue? queue)
            (set-front-ptr! queue new-pair)
            (set-rear-ptr! queue new-pair)
            queue)
            (else
            (set-mcdr! (rear-ptr queue) new-pair)
            (set-rear-ptr! queue new-pair)
            queue)
            )))
    (define (delete-queue! queue)
        (cond ((empty-queue? queue)
            (error "DELETE! called with an empty queue" queue))
            (else (set-front-ptr! queue (mcdr (front-ptr queue)))
            queue)))
    (define (dispatch m) 
    (cond ((eq? m 'empty-queue?) empty-queue?)
        ((eq? m 'front-ptr) front-ptr)
        ((eq? m 'rear-ptr) rear-ptr)
        ((eq? m 'set-front-ptr!) set-front-ptr!)
        ((eq? m 'set-rear-ptr!) set-rear-ptr!)
        ((eq? m 'insert-queue!) insert-queue!)
        ((eq? m 'delete-queue!) delete-queue!)
        (else
            (error "Undefined operation: CONS" m))))
dispatch))
```

### 3.23

I made a double pointer element to represent the deque.

Maybe I'd write some selectors for the element itself. It's confusing using `mcar` and `mcdr` now.

`((element front-end) rear-end)`

```

(define (make-deque) (mcons '() '()))
(define (empty-deque? deque)
 (null? (front-ptr deque)))
(define (front-ptr deque) (mcar deque))
(define (rear-ptr deque) (mcdr deque))
(define (set-front-ptr! deque item)
 (set-mcar! deque item))
(define (set-rear-ptr! deque item)
 (set-mcdr! deque item))

 (define (front-deque deque)
 (if (empty-deque? deque)
 (error "FRONT called with an empty deque" deque)
 (mcar (front-ptr deque))))

 (define (rear-deque deque)
 (if (empty-deque? deque)
 (error "FRONT called with an empty deque" deque)
 (mcar (rear-ptr deque))))

(define (front-insert-deque! deque item)
 (let ((new-pair (mcons (mcons item '()) '()) ))
 (cond ((empty-deque? deque)
 (set-front-ptr! deque new-pair)
 (set-rear-ptr! deque new-pair)
 deque)
(else
 (set-mcdr! new-pair (front-ptr deque))
 (set-mcdr! (mcar (front-ptr deque)) new-pair)
 (set-front-ptr! deque new-pair)
 deque))))

(define (rear-insert-deque! deque item)
 (let ((new-pair (mcons (mcons item '()) '()) ))
 (cond ((empty-deque? deque)
 (set-front-ptr! deque new-pair)
 (set-rear-ptr! deque new-pair)
 deque)
(else
 (set-mcdr! (rear-ptr deque) new-pair)
 (set-mcdr! (mcar new-pair) (rear-ptr-deque))

Just rewrite assoc, all the inner methods use assoc to locate the key.

```
(define (make-table same-key?)
  (define (assoc key records)
  (cond ((null? records) false)
        ((same-key? key (caar records)) 
         (car records))
        (else (assoc key (cdr records)))))
  .......
)
```

Sure enough you come.

```
(define (assoc key records)
  (cond ((null? records) false)
        ((equal? key (car (car records))) 
         (car records))
        (else (assoc key (cdr records)))))

(define (lookup keys table)
  (define (find-final keys-left table-now)
    (let ((record (assoc (car keys-left) (cdr table) )))
      (if record
        (if (null? (cdr keys-left))
          (car record)
          (find-final (cdr keys-left) record)
        )
        false))
  )
  (find-final keys table)
)

(define (insert! keys value table)
  (define (aux remain-keys table-now)
    (let ((record (assoc (car keys) (cdr table))))
      (if record
        (if (null? remain-keys) 
          (set-cdr! record value)
          (aux (cdr remain-keys) record)
        )
        (begin
          (set-cdr! table (cons (cons (car remain-keys) '()) (cdr table)  )  )
          (aux remain-keys table)
        )
      )
      'ok
    )
  )
  (aux keys table)
)
```
